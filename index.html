                I have been preoccupied not only with the spatiality but also

                    In the field of architecture and design the students 
                    learn and acquire knowledge, skills, values and attitudes.
                    These are basically inculcated within the social and 
                    academic environment and through the content and trajectory 
                    of the academic programs.  </br>  </br>
    
                    As architectural and design knowledge is continually 
                    expanding and evolving, education should also promote 
                    skills and attitudes for a flexible and independent 
                    life long learning process in order to probe into, 
                    analyze and evaluate new knowledge.  </br>  </br>
    
                    Architecture and design is a multi-disciplinary  
                    field of study encompassing the wide net of design,  
                    the socio-economic and cultural context, the environmental, 
                    legal and technological aspects, communication skills and
                    professional studies and management; that draws upon and
                    is informed by the other branches of knowledge – the arts,
                    sciences, social sciences, philosophy, engineering and 
                    technology, etc. </br> </br>
    
                    Design studio can provide a setting where an independent 
                    creative, inventive, speculative and innovative endeavor 
                    within the multi-faceted aspects of architecture and design 
                    can be pursued and undertaken.  </br>  </br>
    
                    'Design as a process’ is an inherent predicate of 'design as 
                    a product’. Hence, students’ dexterity in creating drawings 
                    and models as design communication tools should be hinged and 
                    grounded on the analytical-critical, multitasking thinking processes.  </br>  </br>
                    
                    As architecture and design is a multi-disciplinary integrated 
                    program, education should likewise promote collaborative work 
                    and participative process involving the various stakeholders 
                    and allied professionals.  </br>

                    'Design as a process' is the predicate of 'design as 
                    a product'. A more meaningful design is based on a 
                    priori design concept grounded on the abstraction 
                    (“abstrahere”) of certain ideas, insight, nuance etc. 
                    for the intended product/artifact even before the non-abstracting 
                    work of detailing starts. To abstract is to make something 
                    intelligible out of something sensible. </br> </br>
    
                    If 'design as a process' is a way to the mountain top the a 
                    priori design process establishes at the outset the mountain 
                    top and plots the possible roads into it. The a posteriori 
                    design process however, by a series of accruing steps finds 
                    the mountain top and realizes it only once it is there. What 
                    complicates the process is that there could be many equally 
                    valid mountain tops! </br> </br> </br> </br>
    
                    <span class="statements-head">on spatial quality</span> </br> 
                    The determinants of the quality of space are namely:
                    the functionality, the comfort or ease of occupancy, 
                    the image or character, the atmosphere or the ambiance, 
                    the environmental aspects (sustainability, recyclability, 
                    etc.), the technical aspects (serviceability, accessibility, 
                    etc.), and the experiential, intellectual, emotional realms.  </br> </br>

                    <span class="statements-head">on the intimacy in architecture and design</span> </br>
                    Intimacy in architecture is layered within the dimension 
                    of personal appreciation (or rejection) of an architectural 
                    space. The degree of closeness or familiarity may have been 
                    acquired through the customary or constant use of the space
                    over time. The subjectivity of this closeness ultimately
                    varies from individual to individual due to the uniqueness of each person.
                    Nevertheless, there are architectural subtleties, which 
                    trigger almost the same or related effects to people of 
                    varied backgrounds or sensibilities. What is ugly is ugly 
                    (or uglier to some). It may not be probably awe inspiring to 
                    one - unless one possesses an abhorrent or discordant sensibility. 
                    Then, it is more of an exemption.
                    Architecture defines the quality our lives, 
                    affects our attitudes and eventually affords certain behavior to 
                    happen so we may adapt to the environment. The built environment 
                    presents opportunities, which may be deliberately planned in a way 
                    that steps may invite sitting; or may lead to an unplanned effect 
                    where a passageway can cause people to recoil in it and, therefore, 
                    reject it. </br> </br>
